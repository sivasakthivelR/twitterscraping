By using the “snscrape” Library, Scrape the twitter data from Twitter Reference.

Create a dataframe with date, id, url, tweet content, user,reply count, retweet count,language, source, like count.

Store each collection of data into a document into Mongodb along with the hashtag or key word we use to  Scrape from twitter. 

Create a GUI using streamlit that should contain the feature to enter the keyword or Hashtag to be searched, 
select the date range and limit the tweet count need to be scraped.
After scraping, the data needs to be displayed in the page and need a button to upload the data into Database and download the data into csv and json format.

       I have to build a solution that should be able to scrape the twitter data and store that in the database and allow the user to download the data 
       with multiple data formats.
